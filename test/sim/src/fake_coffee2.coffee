 This is the fizzbuzz test in literate CoffeeScript.

# What should FizzBuzz do?

  The FizzBuzz test should print:

 - 'fizz' for every number divisible by 3,
 - 'buzz' for every number divisible by 5,
 - 'fizzbuzz' if the number is divisible by 3 and 5
 - else: just print the number.

# Fun Facts

  FizzBuzz is commonly used to interview programmers and test their coding skills.
 Once the author [@rmetzler](http://github.com/rmetzler) was asked on a job interview
 to write a "coding test". He answered by asking if the meant test was FizzBuzz. The interviewer
 said yes and made a statement to not test the interviewee. The author later learned he didn't
 get the job, was sad and decided on writing FizzBuzz as a learning tool.


# FizzBuzz in CoffeeScript

 FizzBuzz in CoffeeScript could look like this:

###
fizzbuzz = (number) ->
  return 'fizzbuzz' if 0 == number % 15
  return 'buzz'     if 0 == number % 5
  return 'fizz'     if 0 == number % 3
  number.toString()

  for x in [1..100]

# pretty print
    console.log "#{x}\t->\t#{fizzbuzz x}"
