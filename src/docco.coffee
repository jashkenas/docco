# **Docco** is a quick-and-dirty, hundred-line-long, literate-programming-style
# documentation generator. It produces HTML that displays your comments
# alongside your code. Comments are passed through
# [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), and code is
# passed through [Pygments](http://pygments.org/) syntax highlighting.
# This page is the result of running Docco against its own source file.
#
# If you install Docco, you can run it from the command-line:
#
#     docco src/*.coffee
#
# ...will generate linked HTML documentation for the named source files, saving
# it into a `docs` folder.
#
# The [source for Docco](http://github.com/jashkenas/docco) is available on
# GitHub, and released under the MIT license.
#
# To install Docco, first make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/),
# [Pygments](http://pygments.org/) (install the latest dev version of Pygments
# from [its Mercurial repo](http://dev.pocoo.org/hg/pygments-main)), and
# [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/). Then, with NPM:
#
#     sudo npm install docco
#
# If **Node.js** doesn't run on your platform, or you'd prefer a more convenient
# package, get [Rocco](http://rtomayko.github.com/rocco/), the Ruby port that's
# available as a gem. If you're writing shell scripts, try
# [Shocco](http://rtomayko.github.com/shocco/), a port for the **POSIX shell**.
# Both are by [Ryan Tomayko](http://github.com/rtomayko). If Python's more
# your speed, take a look at [Nick Fitzgerald](http://github.com/fitzgen)'s
# [Pycco](http://fitzgen.github.com/pycco/).


#### Main Documentation Generation Functions

# Processes the command line arguments, returns a hash with options and an
# array of positional arguments for the source files. This allows the user to
# pass some flags from the command line rather than modifying the file
# everytime.
parse_args = ->
  opts    = {}
  sources = []
  args    = process.ARGV
  while arg = args.shift()
    # When we see a command line flag, do some slight processing on it, by
    # removing the preceding dashes first, and then grabbing the value it
    # refers to.
    #
    # We finish by sticking the arg=value pair in the `opts` object. Note
    # that no processing is done on the argument's value. We assume all of
    # them to be plain strings.
    if /^--?/.test arg
      arg = arg.replace /^--?/, ''
      opts[arg] = args.shift()

    # But if we don't get a command line flag, we just put the argument in
    # the sources list.
    else
      sources.push arg

  # And after all this small processing is done, we return an Array where the
  # first element is the `opts` object, and the second is the sources list.
